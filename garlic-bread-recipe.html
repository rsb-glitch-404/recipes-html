            About: Usually made with a French Baguette and something you pick up at the store, garlic bread is a nice snack or breakfast for one to have when in a savoury mood.
            This iteration in particular is a bit different, as it uses more accessible ingredients for you to make this whenever you want
            It will end up as a sandwich of which both slices of bread are covered with the garlic mix, and an egg will be added as garnish so you feel fancier and not as unhealthy.
