            About: A staple of a snack for those of all ages to enjoy, the chocolate chip cookie is one of the most famous cookies to have ever been made.
            Of course it started in America, however it's been around since the 1930s with multiple variations, whether its making the cookie itself chocolate, adding white chocolate, caramel, you name it.
            That being said, it means this recipe can only encapsulate the basic cookie, so if you're new to baking familiarise yourself with this recipe first before trying to customise it with your own toppings
